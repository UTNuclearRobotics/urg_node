First plug in all hokuyo connections.

Ensure a couple of ros pacakges are installed to build correctly:
sudo apt install ros-kinetic-laser-proc
sudo apt install ros-kinetic-urg-c

Place the urg_node package within your desired workspace:
-via submodule or git clone the following the repository

Ensure your computer has an ip address, netmask, and gateway of:
ip = 192.168.1.xx
nm = 255.255.255.0
gw = 192.168.1.1

Should be able to check the lidar connection now:

open terminal 1:
roscore

open terminal 2:
source $(your workspace)/devel/setup.bash
rosrun urg_node getID 192.168.1.13:10940
--output should git the ID of the hokuyo device
--in my case is was H1645521
rosrun urg_node urg_node _ip_address:="192.168.1.13"
