First plugged in all hokuyo connections.

Created an hokuyo_ws:
cd ~/
mkdir -p ~/hokuyo_ws/src
catkin build

Git cloned the urg_node
cd ~/hokuyo/src
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node.git

Needed to install a couple of ros pacakges to build correctly:
sudo apt install ros-kinetic-laser-proc
sudo apt isntall ros-kinetic-urg-c

Built the hokuyo_ws with the urg_node package
catkin build
source ~/hokuyo_ws/devel/setup.bash

MIGHT NOT NEED THIS STEP	Created a new ethernet connection:
MIGHT NOT NEED THIS STEP	Top right connections -> Edit Connections -> Add
MIGHT NOT NEED THIS STEP	Select Ethernet -> Create
MIGHT NOT NEED THIS STEP	Tab IPv4 Settings -> Select Manual from drop down -> Add
MIGHT NOT NEED THIS STEP	Enter 192.168.0.10 Address -> Enter 
MIGHT NOT NEED THIS STEP	Enter 255.255.255.0 Netmask-> Enter 
MIGHT NOT NEED THIS STEP	Enter 192.168.0.1 Gateway -> Enter -> Save

Messed with the internal networking interfaces
sudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces
	Added the following lines to force the static ip address of the computer to 192.168.0.15

	"# The primary network interface:
	 auto enp2s0
	 iface enp2s0 inet static
	 address 192.168.0.15
	 netmask 255.255.255.0
	 gateway 192.168.0.1"

sudo reboot
--after reboot--
sudo ip addr flush enp2s0
sudo systemctl restart networking.service
sudo reboot
--after reboot--

Now if the network manager does not display the ethernet ports to manage you can fix this with:
sudo gedit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
	changed the line "managed=false" to "managed=true"
sudo service network-manager restart

Via the network manager connected to the ifupdown (enp2s0)

open terminal 1:
roscore
open terminal 2:
source hokuyo_ws/devel/setup.bash
rosrun urg_node getID 192.168.0.10:10940
--output should git the ID of the hokuyo device
--in my case is was H1645521
rosrun urg_node urg_node _ip_address:="192.168.0.10"
